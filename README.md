# Task
The goal of this project is to build a neural machine translation system and experience how recent advances have made their way. Each team will build the following sequence of neural translation systems for two language pairs, Vietnamese (Vi)→English (En) and Chinese (Zh)→En (prepared corpora will be provided):

1. Recurrent neural network based encoder-decoder without attention
2. Recurrent neural network based encoder-decoder with attention
3. Replace the recurrent encoder with either convolutional or self-attention based encoder.
